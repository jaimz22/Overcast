An easy to use wrapper for the [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/) API (formerly [Forecast.io](https://forecast.io)).

Overcast will query the Dark Sky API for weather information for the longitude and latitude you specify. Additionally
you may specify the specific time, past or present.

See the [Dark Sky API documentation](https://darksky.net/dev/docs) for more information.

## Installation
Installation is as simple as using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/):

```
{
    "require": {
        "vertigolabs/overcast": "dev-master"
    }
}
```
Note: PHP 5.4 or greater is required

## Client Adapters
Overcast uses client adapters to connect to the Dark Sky API. This gives you the ability to create your own adapter for whatever HTTP client you'd like to use. This is especially useful for people who have special needs when dealing with retrieving data from third parties (firewalls, proxies, etc)

Overcast comes with two client adapters ready for use, FileGetContentsClientAdapter and GuzzleClientAdapter. You can also create your own by simply implementing the ClientAdapterInterface
 
By default, you do not have to specify which adapter to use. Overcast will automatically use the best client adapter available. If Guzzle is installed, it will use the GuzzleClientAdaptor, otherwise it will fallback to the FileGetContentsClientAdapter.

If you do wish to specify the client adapter, you'd do this with the second parameter when instancing the Overcast class:

```php
$overcast = new \VertigoLabs\Overcast\Overcast('YOUR API KEY', new \VertigoLabs\Overcast\ClientAdapters\FileGetContentsClientAdapter());
// or
$overcast = new \VertigoLabs\Overcast\Overcast('YOUR API KEY', new MyAwesomeClientAdapter());
```

## Example
Since the Dark Sky API is simple, Overcast is equally easy to use.
Simply create an instance of the Overcast class, then call the getForecast() method.

Overcast::getForecast() returns a nicely structured Forecast object which contains other data structures for handy access to all of the response data from Dark Sky.

```php
$overcast = new \VertigoLabs\Overcast\Overcast('YOUR API KEY');
$forecast = $overcast->getForecast(37.8267,-122.423);

// check the number of API calls you've made with your API key for today
echo $overcast->getApiCalls().' API Calls Today'."\n";

// temperature current information
echo 'Current Temp: '.$forecast->getCurrently()->getTemperature()->getCurrent()."\n";
echo 'Feels Like: '.$forecast->getCurrently()->getApparentTemperature()->getCurrent()."\n";
echo 'Min Temp: '.$forecast->getCurrently()->getTemperature()->getMin()."\n";
echo 'Max Temp: '.$forecast->getCurrently()->getTemperature()->getMax()."\n";

// get daily summary
echo 'Daily Summary: '.$forecast->getDaily()->getSummary()."\n";

// loop daily data points
foreach($forecast->getDaily()->getData() as $dailyData) {
	echo 'Date: '.$dailyData->getTime()->format('D, M jS y')."\n";
	// get daily temperature information
	echo 'Min Temp: '.$dailyData->getTemperature()->getMin()."\n";
	echo 'Max Temp: '.$dailyData->getTemperature()->getMax()."\n";

	// get daily precipitation information
	echo 'Precipitation Probability: '.$dailyData->getPrecipitation()->getProbability()."\n";
	echo 'Precipitation Intensity: '.$dailyData->getPrecipitation()->getIntensity()."\n";

	// get other general daily information
	echo 'Wind Speed: '.$dailyData->getWindSpeed()."\n";
	echo 'Wind Direction: '.$dailyData->getWindBearing()."\n";
	echo 'Visibility: '.$dailyData->getVisibility()."\n";
	echo 'Cloud Coverage: '.$dailyData->getCloudCover()."\n";
}
```

This will output:
